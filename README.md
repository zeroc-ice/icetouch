# Ice Touch

Ice Touch brings [Ice](https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice) for Objective-C and C++ to iOS devices.

With Ice Touch, you can build iOS apps that communicate with each other and with Ice servers running on macOS, Windows, or Linux. You can implement these servers in any of the languages supported by Ice (C++, Java, C#, Python, Objective-C).

Ice Touch provides development kits and run-times for iOS devices, the
iOS simulator, and macOS.
